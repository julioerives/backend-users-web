If you don't have Docker, you need to have MySQL and Node.js installed to run the application. To run the application without Docker, you need to execute the **proyectoweb_users.sql** file. After that, you should run **npm run dev** for development mode. For production mode, you have to run **npm run build** and then **npm run start** to build and start the application.
